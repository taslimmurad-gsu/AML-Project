# AML-Project

In this project, we try to solve a problem of Kaggle competition

In the code folder, there is a folder with the name "baselines", which contains Python code for basic classification algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Perceptron. 

For the dimensionality reduction, PCA is performed and 20 components are taken. The values for PCA can be checked in a figure with name "pca components.png" in the Dataset_Statistics folder.

For data preprocessing, we plot Histograms to evaluate the distribution of classes.
