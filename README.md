# AML-Project

In this project, we try to solve a problem of Kaggle competition
https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/overview

In the code folder, there is a folder with the name "baselines", which contains Python code for basic classification algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Perceptron. 

For the dimensionality reduction, PCA is performed and 20 components are taken. The values for PCA can be checked in a figure with name "pca components.png" in the Dataset_Statistics folder.

For data preprocessing, we plot Histograms to evaluate the distribution of classes.

In Dataset_Statistics folder, you can find the visualization of some of the features in the dataset.

To run Faster rcnn, please refer to FRCNN_obj_detection.ipynb. It would require help_files folder to run this notebook successfully.
